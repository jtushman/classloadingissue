== Weirdest Classloading bug ever!!

The issue seems to happen only with the intersection of to Gems.  If you remove either one it works, but both together
cause the issue

to replicate:

> bundle install
> rails c

> Reductions::ConversionsByBucket
 => Reductions::ConversionsByBucket 
> Reductions::ConversionsByBucket.hello
 => NoMethodError: undefined method `hello' for Reductions::ConversionsByBucket:Class
> require 'reductions/conversions_by_bucket.rb'
 => nil
> Reductions::ConversionsByBucket.hello
 => "hello"


Go to the Gemfile, comment out either
gem 'inherited_resources', '1.2.2'                                                        # Keeps Controllers neat
gem 'aws-s3', '0.6.2',:require =>"aws/s3"                                                 # Amazon s3 manipulation

and ...
> rm Gemfile.lock
> bundle install
> rails c
>> Reductions::ConversionsByBucket.hello
>> "hello"
